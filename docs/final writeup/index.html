	<h1>CS184 Final Project: Rendering Velvet Skirts</h1>
	<h4>Team: Jessica Dong, Kelly Li, Kaiona Martinson, Jennifer Yang</h4>
	<h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17z3JwDzp23XD4tda20C_WA69vgi0jmut/view?usp=sharing">Final Video</a></h2>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

		<p1>The clothing industry produces 10% of the world’s global carbon emissions. Additionally, each season, clothes are
			overproduced by 30 to 40%. We wanted to take a stab at rendering clothing since modeling clothing with graphics
			can help reduce waste when designing clothing, mocking up prototypes without directly using expensive fabric,
			and online shopping. We decided to render a velvet skirt because velvet has a lot of interesting properties.
			Specifically, the color of velvet can change depending on the direction of the fibers or the perspective you’re
			looking at it from.</p1>

	<h2>Technical Approach</h2>

		<p1>The references for both the velvet and skirt were mainly used as starting points for our project, with the velvet
			features in the project mostly being done by eye.</p1>
	<h3>Velvet</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>For the velvet, we referenced Google’s github site for the Filament project, which helped us determine
				the base color (ambient coefficient) to be black, as well as the relation between the diffuse color
				and sheen color (specular).</li>
			<li>We modified the existing blinn-phong coefficients to render a more realistic velvet. We changed the
				diffuse coefficient to a red color to make our base cloth red, the ambient coefficient to a black
				color to make the shadows darker, and the specular coefficient to a brighter red (instead of white)
				to make the fabric look less like latex / metal.</li>
			<li>We also increased the spring constant and density of the fabric in the clothSim gui to make our
				fabric heavier, as well as adding bump mapping with an image of a red velvet from Google.</li>
			<li>We referenced a KeyShot article that described different features of velvet like sheen, roughness,
				backscatter, and edginess to ballpark the variable values that would make our velvet look more
				realistic.</li>

		</ul>
		
		
	
	<h3>Skirt</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>For the skirt, we referenced the paper, A 3D Design System of Skirt Profile Based on OpenGL, that got
				us started on the basic skirt shape. We made a series of circles of varying radius size and height.
				We started with a circle with radius size = width / 4 and height = height. We incremented the radius
				size and decremented height by an offset to get num_height_points circles, where the bottom circle
				has a radius size = width and height = 0. For each circle, we had num_width_points number of point
				masses, each with position (radius size * cos(Θ), height, radius size * sin(Θ)), where Θ ranged from
				0 to 2π. We got the equations from the paper.</li>

			<li>We then connected the point masses with springs like in project 4: structural constraint between a
				point mass and the point mass to its left and above it, shearing constraints between a point mass
				and the point mass to its diagonal upper left and its diagonal upper right, and bending constraints
				between a point mass and the point mass two to its left and two above it.</li>

			<figcaption align="left">Preliminary skirt with mirror shading</figcaption>
			<br />
			<li>For all the circles, we pinned every fifth point mass to create a pleat effect that was visible once
				we started the simulation and accounted for the effect of gravity on the skirt. We did the pleat
				effect by eye. </li>

			<li>After combining our custom .frag velvet fragment and skirt grid, we added a couple of modifications
				to make the overall skirt shape more realistic (more “hip” since we added a hip :D). To make the skirt
				less conic after the simulation starts, we included a variable named taper to decrease how much the
				radius increases by as we go down the skirt. We also included a variable that controls when the
				pleated pins stop (around 30% down from the waistband), thus allowing the rest of the fabric to drape
				down naturally with gravitational force. This made the skirt look less tent-like and more curved.</li>
		</ul>
	
	


	<h2>Problems Encountered</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>We initially drafted up a skirt in Blender but had issues with importing the model into our code. We then
			decided to render the skirt using point masses and springs like in project 4.

			<figcaption align="left">Skirt in Blender</figcaption>
			<br/>
		</li>
		<li>We encountered an issue where there was an apparent side seam missing from the skirt. Though our wireframe
			was correct, the original clothsim expected the cloth to be rectangular in shape, thus the code for creating
			the clothmesh which allows for the rendering of fabric color did not allow for a conically-shaped piece of
			fabric. To fix this, we altered the buildClothMesh function in cloth.cpp to check when the pointmass was the
			last pointmass in its row, in which we would create triangles that connect back to the first pointmasses in
			the row. This ended up fixing the gap.

		</li>
	</ul>




 <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>This was our first time using Blender, so that definitely came with a learning curve full of watching video
			tutorials and playing around with the software.</li>
		<li>Since we only had experience with making flat rectangular grids from the clothsim project, making the conic
			shape was a valuable learning experience.  </li>
		<li>Velvet has some cool anisotropic features that can be approximated by eye. We did a lot of eye-balling to get
			realistic-looking fabric. </li>
	</ul>
